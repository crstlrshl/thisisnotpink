      <h1>Pink doesn't exist...</h1>
      <p>
        Lately, pink has come under fire thanks to Henry Reich and his fun and informative Minute Physics.
        (Seriously,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics/about">go subscribe to his channel</a>; it's awesome.
        In a 2011 video on YouTube, Reich "proves" that magenta (what he calls pink) cannot exist, either because it could only exist in space already occupied by radio and gamma rays,
        among other things, or because magenta is really only the absence of green.

        <h2>"Pink is real – or it is not – but it is just as real or not-real as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet."</h2>
        <p>In defense of the color, <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/stop-this-absurd-war-on-the-color-pink/">Scientific American's Michael Moyer</a> delved into optical science and noted that,
        given the complicated process of photons and neurons interacting with our cones and brains, all colors could be considered a trick of the mind.
        He finished with: "Pink is real – or it is not – but it is just as real or not-real as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet."</p>
